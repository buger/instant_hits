            <h2>Hi, My name is Gerard Connely, Creator of Droid Generator... a full time Internet Marketer and App Developer...  I'd like to tell you how I went from ripping my hair out struggling to make a buck online..  To working 2 hours per day creating Android Apps that bring in Thousands of dollars per week.</h2>

            <h3>What you need to know about Millionaire Society</h3>

            <p>I got started in affiliate marketing in 2004 without success but kept at it in my spare time.  I stayed current on all the SEO tactics, (white and black hat) and developed a great product.  I eventually found great success in 2007 on CB and CJ for one of my Forex products selling over 3,000 copies of my software at $149 a pop.  I ended up doing so well I quit my day job as a retail manager in Brooklyn N.Y. and became a full time Affiliate Marketer and Web Developer.  Things couldn't have been better.</p>

            <p>In 2009, sales of my software came to an abrupt halt.  Not because my software didn't work, but because the market got so saturated with affiliate products.  There was just too much competition in my niche.  By mid 2009, I was scrambling.  I tryed to get my job back as a retail manager, but the economy was just too weak; they didn't need me.</p>

            <br/>
            <h3>The main quality of this product</h3>

            <p>Being that my background was in the Internet Marketing field.. I took a totally different approach distributing my apps then the conventional "$1 per app" methodology....</p>

            <p>Instead of making cheesy apps and charging people a buck...  I used the technology as a platform to give away free apps so I could build enormous targeted opt-in email lists.</p>
